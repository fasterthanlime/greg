greg is a re-entrant peg/leg, with some bug fixes.

The original peg/leg 0.1.9 was released with re-entrant capabilities.

And now most relevant features of greg (e.g., error handling) are
being integrated into the original peg/leg software

The most comprehensive example of greg usage is in nagaqueen, an ooc
grammar, used in rock, an ooc compiler written in ooc.
